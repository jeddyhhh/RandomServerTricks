//Ranges are 1 to 100, anything else will screw things up. 
//Default values generate "do-able" tricks, try playiong with the numbers, I'm sure something will break lol.
//The lower the number, the higher the chance of it coming up. 
//Private trick generation is limited to 7 because it likes to crash the server if you go over 10. Looking into fixing it.
